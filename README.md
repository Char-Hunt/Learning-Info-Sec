### Frameworks and Controls
The **_Pyramid of Pain_** is a conceptual model for the effective use of Cyber Threat Intelligence in threat detection operations, with a particular emphasis on increasing the adversaries' cost of operations. It's method for understanding cybersecurity threats that organizes IOCs into six different levels. 
Information security expert **DAVID J. BIANCO** was the first to formalize this idea.

     Bianco's philosophy -- "Forget the Defender's Dilemma and recognize that we have a lot of chances to succeed. We may not have the resources to take them all, but by choosing wisely, we can make an attacker's job MUCH harder while giving ourselves the best chance of success."

David Bianco's concepts and ideas have helped shape the landscape of hacker defensive tactics and instrusion analysis.

### Types of encryption

You may be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat are the types of encryption?‚Äù This is a good question to ask. Computerized encryption methods generally belong to one of two kinds of encryption:

   - [Symmetric key encryption](https://github.com/Char-Hunt/Ecryption-Foundations/blob/main/README.md#ecryption-foundations)
   - Public key encryption

Public-key cryptography is sometimes called asymmetric cryptography. It is an encryption scheme that uses two mathematically related, but non-identical, keys. One is a **public** key and the other a **private** key. Unlike symmetric key algorithms that rely on a single key to handle the encrypt and decrypt functions, each key performs a unique process. The **public key** is used to _encrypt_ and the **private** key is used to _decrypt_ data. 

So, say for example we need to confidentially send a plain text message to someone. We'll use our friends "Alice" and "Bob" to illustrate how it works. In a nutshell, the mathematical relation, sometimes referred to as a "_hash_", in certain forms, makes it possible to encode a message using a person‚Äôs public key. To decode it a matching private key is used so that the plain text or data is recognizable on the recipients's end. Here's an infographic that outlines the flow:

‚ö°The Importance of Being Cyber-aware: Cybersecurity Training and Awareness Programs‚ö°

You cannot promise that your organization will not be breached, especially when intrusions are taking place by the thousands, even millions each hour. Also, when the inevitable breach happens--it's not a question of if it happens, it's actually a question of when it occurs--your stakeholders can trust your organization to respond quickly and protect their interests. But you should be able to say that you‚Äôve secured the infrastructure your organization‚Äôs sustainable growth depends on.

Companies and organizations are spending more on cybersecurity and privacy than ever before and as businesses are allocating resources accordingly on processes (governance), compliance, people, and technology.
