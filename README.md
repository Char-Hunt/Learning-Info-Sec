### Hi there 👋 Hi | Hello | bonjour | こんにちは | ሰላም | नमस्कार | kamusta na | Mālō | ஹலோ | Hola | Hallo | مرحبا
Continuous learning and collaboration are the basic tenets of my security awareness philosophy.

## As a Cybersecurity Practioner, I evaluate risk assessments at a system level, focusing on process, controls, monitoring or incident response and recovery activities; ITSM and engineering with an eye toward customer problem resolution, compliance, governance and risk.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on InfoSec, IT Security and Cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, linux for SOC, ML, and IAM.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on SIEM, DR, and vulnerability tools.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with threat assessment tips and any of the above.
- 💬 Ask me about how resiliency, risk, ethics, and customer experience can be intersectional.
- 📫 How to reach me: Find me online and [Learn More.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charhunte)
